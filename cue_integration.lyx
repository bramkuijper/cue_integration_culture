\begin_layout Abstract
Most analyses of the origins of cultural evolution focus on when and where
 social learning prevails over individual learning, overlooking the fact
 that there are other developmental inputs that influence phenotypic fit
 to the selective environment.
 This raises the question how the presence of other cue `channels' affects
 the scope for social learning.
 Here, we present a model that considers the simultaneous evolution of (i)
 multiple forms of social learning (involving vertical or horizontal learning
 based on either prestige or conformity biases) within the broader context
 of other evolving inputs on phenotype determination, including (ii) heritable
 epigenetic factors, (iii) individual learning, (iv) environmental and cascading
 maternal effects, (v) conservative bet-hedging and (vi) genetic cues.
 In fluctuating environments that are autocorrelated (and hence predictable),
 we find that social learning from members of the same generation (horizontal
 social learning) explains the large majority of phenotypic variation, whereas
 other cues are much less important.
 Moreover, social learning based on prestige biases typically prevails in
 positively autocorrelated environments, whereas conformity biases prevail
 in negatively autocorrelated environments.
 Only when environments are unpredictable or horizontal social learning
 is characterised by an intrinsically low information content, other cues
 such as conservative bet-hedging or vertical prestige biases prevail.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Social learning, the ability to acquire information from other individuals,
 is a fundamental requirement to cultural evolution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cavalli-Sforza1981,Boyd1985,Henrich2003,Aoki2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, a substantial amount of theoretical work has sought to identify
 the ecological conditions in which selection favours social learning as
 opposed to individual learning (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Henrich2003,Aoki2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for reviews), finding that a mixture of both social and individual learning
 is expected to evolve in fluctuating environments (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rogers1988,Feldman1996,Aoki2005,Laland2004,Rendell2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the conventional focus on the evolution of social versus individual
 learning overlooks that individuals can also obtain information about their
 environments by other means.
 For example, in spatially varying environments an individual's genotype
 can become statistically associated to its environment through local adaptation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kawecki2004,Savolainen2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, favouring the evolution of genetic cues for phenotypic development 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Leimar2006,Dall2015,Leimar2016,Leimar2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In environments that fluctuate predictably over time, theory predicts that
 individuals are selectively favoured to rely on transgenerational cues
 that stem from their parent's phenotype or the parental environment (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kuijper2015,Leimar2015,English2015,Kuijper2016,Proulx_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), transmitted through heritable DNA/histone modifications, parental hormones
 or even parent-offspring teaching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Danchin2011,Radford2018,Boskovic2018,Groothuis2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Next, rather than relying on direct or indirect cues about the environment,
 individuals may also be selectively favoured to rely on mechanisms that
 generate phenotypic variation instead (e.g., bet-hedging: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Seger1989,Starrfelt2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Consequently, the availability of cues other than social or individual
 learning raises the question how organisms should integrate multiple cues
 when adapting to different environments and how, in turn, this affects
 the evolutionary scope for social versus individual learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While there are a large number of theoretical studies which have analysed
 the evolutionary implications of subsets of two or three developmental
 cues (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Leimar2006,Shea2011,Kuijper2014a,Tufto2015,Gestel2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), only a limited number of these studies have sought to predict how organisms
 should integrate a larger number of available cues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rivoire2014,Botero2015,McNamara2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These studies find that the rate of environmental change and the degree
 of environmental predictability are key parameters in determining which
 cue is most important in phenotype determination, while reliance on mixtures
 of multiple cues typically occurs in more restrictive settings.
 However, these studies have only focused on integration of individual and
 parental cues (e.g., genetic cues, bet-hedging, parental effects and individual
 learning [phenotypic plasticity]).
 By contrast, the potential to acquire information via different socially
 learned cues is yet to be considered in a context that tracks the joint
 evolution of multiple cues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand how the integration of multiple cues affects the evolution
 of different social learning mechanisms, we develop a model that tracks
 the evolution of alternative behavioural phenotypes in a spatiotemporally
 fluctuating environment.
 Organisms are selected to develop a behaviour that closely matches the
 local environment by evolving sensitivity to a range of different cues,
 where each of these cues potentially provides information about the local
 environment.
 Foremost, we consider that individuals can evolve sensitivity to socially
 learned cues about the phenotypes of others, who are either members of
 the parental generation (vertical social learning) or of the current generation
 (horizontal social learning).
 We then ask how vertical and horizontal social learning evolve jointly
 with other cues that may affect behavioural development, be it genetic
 cues, individually learned cues (here represented by within-generational
 phenotypic plasticity) and transgenerational cues for phenotype determination
 as in previous models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rivoire2014,Botero2015,McNamara2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, because both horizontal and vertical social learning can potentially
 involve different mechanisms to identify from whom individuals should learn
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Henrich2003,Laland2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the current model allows sensitivity to evolve based on prestige biases
 (individuals obtain cues from the most successful individual) and/or conformity
 biases (individuals obtain cues from the most commonly observed phenotype)
 for vertical and horizontal social learning independently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing theory on the evolution of learning mechanisms (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Henrich2003,Laland2004,Aoki2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) often stresses the role of different costs in driving the evolution of
 social and individual learning.
 For example, social learning is typically thought to result in outdated
 information relative to individual learning, whereas individual learning
 is considered to take more effort, resulting in a producer-scrounger game
 over information (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barnard1981,Rogers1988,Giraldeau2002,Laland2004,Enquist2007,Bossan2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The key focus of the current model is different, however, as we want to
 assess what information different combinations of cues can provide and
 whether some cues can inherently provide more information over and above
 others.
 Consequently, we make no a priori assumptions about the relative costs
 and benefits of one type of cue versus the others, but rather have those
 payoffs emerge from the ecological scenarios (via migration and timing
 of life-history events) that impact the information content of the various
 cues.

The model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We performed individual-based simulations of a sexually reproducing population
 distributed over 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{p}=40$
\end_inset

 patches, each supporting a local population of 
\begin_inset Formula $K=100$
\end_inset

 diploid, hermaphroditic individuals, largely based on a previous model
 on the evolution of transgenerational effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leimar2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While generations are non-overlapping in the sense that only individuals
 born during the current time step reproduce, the model allows offspring
 to obtain information from individuals from the previous generation through
 parental effects and vertical social learning.

Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each patch is either in one of two local environmental states (low: 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{low}}$
\end_inset

, or high: 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{high}}$
\end_inset

), reflecting, for example, the local temperature or the amount of available
 resources.
 Patches can change environmental state independently from other patches
 at each time step: with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 a patch retains its current environmental state during the next time step,
 whereas with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

 it changes to the opposite environmental state (similar to two-state models
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feldman1996,Aoki2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leimar2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we assume that both environments change at identical rates, so the global
 equilibrium frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mathrm{high}}$
\end_inset

 of patches in environmental state 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{high}}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mathrm{high}}=1-f_{\mathrm{low}}=1/2$
\end_inset

, while the between-generation environmental autocorrelation of any patch
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\theta_{t},\theta_{t+1})=2p-1$
\end_inset

, so that when 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 (rapid change), the autocorrelation is 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 (no change), the autocorrelation is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and when 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.5$
\end_inset

 (random change), the autocorrelation is 0.

\begin_layout Subsection
Reproduction and juvenile phenotype determination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before reproduction, adults experience survival selection based on their
 adult phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{ad}}$
\end_inset

 (see eq.
 [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:liability:adult"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

] below), where the probability of adult survival 
\begin_inset Formula $S(u_{\mathrm{ad}},\theta)$
\end_inset

 differs between low and high environments respectively (see Figure 1B and
 the online supplementary information).
 Subsequently, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 newborn offspring are produced by surviving adults.
 Each newborn offspring is produced by randomly selecting a mother and a
 father from among the surviving adult breeders, potentially allowing for
 selfing in case the number of survivors is very small.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon birth, an individual offspring then determines its juvenile phenotype
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 according to genetic, maternal environmental, maternal phenotypic and vertical
 social cues (see Figure 1A and eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:liability:juvenile"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 below).
 The juvenile phenotype is also affected by individual learning of the local
 environment (via juvenile environmental cues), where we assume that individual
 learning occurs before migration unless indicated otherwise.
 Consequently, the juvenile phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 that is developed after individual learning is a logistic function of a
 weighted sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 of different cues an individual has received.
 We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
u_{\mathrm{juv}} & =\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}\right)}\label{eq:liability:juvenile}\\
\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}} & =a_{\mathrm{g}}x_{\mathrm{gen}}+a_{\mathrm{\mathrm{ind}}}x_{\mathrm{ind}}\nonumber \\
 & +m_{\mathrm{m}}x_{\mathrm{mat,phen}}+m_{\mathrm{e}}x_{\mathrm{mat,envt}}\nonumber \\
 & +v_{\mathrm{p}}x_{\mathrm{vert,prestige}}+v_{c}x_{\mathrm{vert,conformity}},\label{eq:xbar:juvenile}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

s in the equation above are the values of each of the different cues (see
 the online supplement for the details of the individual cues).
 We then allow the influence of each cue on juvenile phenotype determination
 to evolve, by assuming that cues are weighed by a set of evolving sensitivity
 loci, here reflected by variables 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{g}}$
\end_inset

 (genetic cue), 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{ind}}$
\end_inset

 (individual learning), 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 (maternal phenotypic cue), 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\mathrm{e}}$
\end_inset

 (maternal environmental cue), 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{p}}$
\end_inset

 (vertical social learning; prestige bias) and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{c}}$
\end_inset

 (vertical social learning; conformity bias) respectively.
 For the sake of tractability, we assume that each sensitivity locus is
 diploid and unlinked to other loci.
 The value of each sensitivity locus is bounded between -10 and 10.
 For example, in the absence of any other cues, a sensitivity value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{p}}=0$
\end_inset

 (vertical social learning sensitivity based on prestige) implies that juveniles
 attain an intermediate juvenile phenotype of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 A negative value of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{p}}$
\end_inset

 implies that when individuals receive a high versus a low value of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{vert,prestige}}$
\end_inset

 cue, they are more likely to develop a low phenotype (
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}<1/2$
\end_inset

) versus a high phenotype (
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}>1/2$
\end_inset

).
 The opposite relationship applies when 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{p}}$
\end_inset

 is positive.
 Note that horizontal social learning only occurs after birth and migration,
 and hence affects phenotypic development later in life (see eqns.
 [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

]).
 How each of the underlying cues 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 are obtained is set out in the online supplement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After juvenile phenotype determination, individuals migrate with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to a randomly chosen remote site, while they remain at the natal site with
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-d$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, we assume that horizontal social learning (see below) occurs
 after migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adult phenotype determination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After juvenile phenotype determination, all adults from the previous generation
 die and individuals learn from other individuals of their current generation
 (horizontal social learning).
 Information acquired from horizontally learned social cues is then used
 by individuals to update the various cue weightings 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 in eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xbar:juvenile"

\end_inset

) and develop an adult phenotype.
 Consequently, the adult phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{ad}}$
\end_inset

 that is developed after horizontal social learning is an updated logistic
 function of a weighted sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{ad}}$
\end_inset

 of the various cues an individual has received.
 We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
u_{\mathrm{ad}} & =\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\bar{x}_{\mathrm{ad}}\right)}\label{eq:liability:adult}\\
\bar{x}_{\mathrm{ad}} & =\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}+h_{\mathrm{p}}x_{\mathrm{horiz,prestige}}+h_{c}x_{\mathrm{horiz,conformity}},\label{eq:xbar:adult}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathrm{p}}$
\end_inset

 (horizontal social learning; prestige bias) and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathrm{c}}$
\end_inset

 (horizontal social learning; conformity bias) again reflect unlinked and
 evolving diploid loci (again bounded between -10 and 10) that reflect sensitivi
ty to both horizontally learned social cues 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{horiz,prestige}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{horiz,}\text{conformity}}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 A full description of the socially learned cues is given in section 2 of
 the online supplement.

Throughout Figure

 phenotypic variation in adult phenotypes, at least when environments are
 sufficiently predictable (by being either sufficiently positively or negatively
 autocorrelated).
 Moreover, dominant cues are always individually or socially learned, as
 opposed to genetic cues or maternal effects.
 In positively autocorrelated environments (left-hand side of each panel

), either individual learning (green lines) or social learning driven by
 prestige biases (horizontal [yellow] or vertical [pink]) prevails.
 Evolved sensitivities to all other cues explain substantially less phenotypic
 variance.
 The prevalence of individual and social learning in predictable environments
 is unsurprising, as either acquiring direct cues about the environment
 (individual learning) or obtaining cues about the sampled phenotype with
 the highest survival in the current environment (prestige-based social
 learning) provides most information about current conditions.

 Indeed, social learning still prevails when it only coevolves with genetic

Result 2: timing of environmental change matters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, we have considered a scenario where the environment changes between
 juvenility and adulthood.

 we consider a scenario where the environment changes at birth instead,
 implying that non-migrant juveniles and adults encounter the same environmental
 conditions.
 For example, this may reflect fluctuating environments where early-life
 conditions are highly predictive of the later-life environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 We now find that either vertical or horizontal social learning based on
 prestige biases dominates all other cues for all rates of change (Figure

 As change only happens at birth, the predicted survival of individuals

 generalises the findings above while varying key parameters that affect
 fidelity of the different cues.
 Specifically, we vary the fidelity of maternal environmental cues versus
 individual learning (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis) and the fidelity of vertical versus horizontal social learning (
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 for similar results when varying the migration rate).
 Similar to Figure

 shows that horizontal social learning prevails over a large range of the
 parameter space when the environment changes at birth, as the survival
 of juveniles is fully informative about the later-life environment (Figure

LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

C, D).
 Only when horizontal social learning becomes highly error prone (towards
 bottom of each panel), is horizontal social learning replaced by vertical
 social learning.
 In either case however, social learning is mostly based on prestige biases.
 Also, we find that there is little difference between positively and negatively
 autocorrelated environments once the environment changes at birth, as in
 this case, the rate of change does not affect the relationship between
 environments experienced between juvenility and adulthood (Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, when the timing of environmental change occurs between juvenility
 and adulthood, horizontal social learning prevails in a more limited range
 of parameters (compare Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:contour_fidelity"

\end_inset

A, B vs C, D).
 Interestingly, we find that the fidelity of individual learning affects
 the evolutionary scope of different social learning mechanisms, as prestige
 based horizontal social learning predominates when individually learned
 cues have a low fidelity (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\mathrm{ind}}\approx0.5$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

A, B).
 By contrast, conformity based horizontal social learning predominates once
 the fidelity of individual learning increases.
 Moreover, also here we find that conformity is more likely to prevail in
 negatively autocorrelated environments than in positively autocorrelated
 ones (see also Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eta_vs_p"

 Finally, in a limited range of parameters where the fidelity of individual
 learning and horizontal and vertical social learning is low (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{h}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{v}}=0.5$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\mathrm{ind}}=0.5$

), we find that environmental maternal effects prevail as it is the only
 cue that has a considerable fidelity (as

).

Overall, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that horizontal social learning (based on either prestige or conformity)
 often predominates when it comes to the development of the adult phenotype.
 This raises the question what cues are important in the development of
 juvenile phenotypes, as those serve as models for horizontal social learning.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we provide the first model of how individual and social learning are
 predicted to coevolve with a multitude of other cues on phenotype determination.
 Our analysis finds that individual learning or social learning (either
 horizontal or vertical) typically prevails over all other cues, be it genetic
 cues, maternal environmental cues, maternal phenotypic cues (i.e., cascading
 maternal effects) or bet-hedging (i.e., no sensitivity to any cue).
 Only when cues provide little information about the future do we find that
 individuals resort to conservative bet-hedging (middle of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eta_vs_p"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Alternatively, when all other cues prove to be unreliable do we find that
 environmental maternal effects are selectively favoured (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:contour_fidelity"
plural "false"
caps "false"

A).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prevalence of individual and social learning is to be expected, as individua
l learning allows individuals to directly detect the state of the local
 environment.
 Social learning provides more indirect information about local conditions,
 as it relies on direct or indirect measures of the performance of others
 in the local environment: when social learning is based on prestige biases,
 individuals use cues from the sampled individual with the best performance
 in the local environment.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:supplement:vary_n"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that even when these cues are based on a sample of just 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 individuals, we still find that socially learned cues (mostly based on
 conformity biases) prevail in a large range of the parameter space.
 Being able to rank the performance of others' phenotypes provides highly
 accurate information about the local environment, particularly when the
 sampled phenotypes themselves have accumulated information from individual
 learning and/or other cues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when environments are negatively autocorrelated (with environmental
 change occurring between juvenility and adulthood), Figures

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:contour_fidelity"

\end_inset

A,B show that conformity biases are considerably more likely to prevail.
 To understand why horizontal conformity biases prevail over prestige biases,
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:correlation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 considers the informative value of all learned cues by depicting their
 correlations with the adult selective environment.
 Surprisingly, in negatively autocorrelated environments, cues based on
 horizontal conformism correlate positively (and relatively strongly) with
 the adult selective environment, whereas horizontal prestige cues are only
 weakly negatively correlated.
 Less surprising is that vertically learned and individually learned cues
 are all negatively correlated with the environment (with individual learned
 cues exhibiting negative correlations of the strongest magnitude), as the
 environment experienced by adults of generation 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 and by juveniles in generation 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is most likely opposite to the selective environment that will be experienced
 later by adults in generation 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do correlations of these different types of social learning with the
 selective environment diverge in negatively autocorrelated environments
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:correlation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

)? Note that juveniles will initially use individual/vertical learning to
 develop a phenotype opposite to their current juvenile environment.
 This is because long-term selection (in a negatively autocorrelated environment
) has shaped reaction norms to anticipate that selective conditions experienced
 in adulthood are likely to differ from the environment experienced as a
 juvenile (indeed, reaction norms based on individual/vertical social learning
 are negative on the right-hand sides of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:suppl:sensitivities"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

B-D, so that juveniles born in a low environment are likely to develop a
 phenotype matching a high environment).
 Once phenotypes based on individual/vertical learning have developed, juveniles
 perform horizontal social learning.
 However, as most juveniles now have phenotypes mismatched to their current
 juvenile environment (but matched to later conditions), individuals are
 most likely to take prestige-based cues from juvenile models with more
 intermediate phenotypes (as models with more extreme phenotypes have very
 low predicted survival values in their juvenile environment and are thus
 disregarded).
 In turn, phenotypes of intermediate value are equally likely to occur in
 any environment, thus resulting in a correlation between horizontal prestige
 and the adult selective environment of a small magnitude.
 By contrast, when socially learned cues are based on horizontal conformity
 biases, a cue is taken that simply reflects the majority of phenotypes
 without considering any measure of current survival.
 Consequently, if a majority of sampled juveniles has a low phenotype, this
 is a good indicator that the adult selective environment will likely be
 in a low state too.
 Consequently, conformity-based horizontal social cues become strongly (and
 positively) correlated with the selective environment.

A,B also shows that the fidelity of individually learned cues affects the
 prevalence of different horizontally learned social cues.
 When individually learned cues have a low fidelity (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\mathrm{ind}}\approx0.5$
\end_inset

), we find that horizontal prestige based cues predominate, while horizontal
 conformity based cues prevail otherwise.
 Why are prestige biased and conformity based social cues differentially
 affected by this fidelity of individual learning? For low fidelities of
 individual learning, the distribution of phenotypes in each local deme
 (before horizontal social learning occurs) is relatively broad, as even
 modest environmental fluctuations at rates 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p=0.2$

 created by local adaptation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Leimar2006,Leimar2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, horizontal social learning based on the most frequent phenotype
 provides little information, as each local deme has a mixture of low and
 high-adapted phenotypes.
 By contrast, prestige-based measures of predicted phenotypic performance
 in the current environment provide a more direct measure of the current
 environment and therefore prevail.
 However, once individual learning has a higher fidelity, it allows individuals
 to modulate their phenotype and match it with the local environment.
 Consequently, individual learning creates a strong association between
 the number of individuals with a low versus a high phenotype and their
 local environment, thus increasing the value of conformity-based horizontal
 social learning, as this is based on strong differences in the numbers
 of low versus high phenotypes between both environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another finding of the current study is that vertical social learning based
 on conformity rarely predominates, similar to genetic and maternal environmenta
l cues.
 Vertical conformity biases rarely dominate because they rely on cues about
 the distribution of parental adult phenotypes, which are, to a large part,
 a result of cues received in their own juvenile environment at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

, resulting in outdated information about adult selection at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 (See also Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:correlation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 showing that the magnitude of the correlation of vertical conformity based
 cues is small relative to other cues).
 By contrast, cues based on vertical prestige biases reflect the performance
 of parental phenotypes in the current (juvenile) environment and are therefore
 superior to vertical conformism.
 Moreover, while the relative importance of horizontal prestige versus horizonta
l conformity is affected by the fidelity of individual learning (see previous
 paragraph), there is no such interaction between individual learning and
 the prevalence of vertical prestige vs vertical conformity cues (see bottom
 of each panel in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:contour_fidelity"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Again, because individually learned cues provide more recent information
 about the environment than vertically learned cues, any increase in the
 fidelity of individual learning tends to replace vertical social learning,
 rather than affect the evolutionary scope of vertical conformity versus
 prestige.
 As found previously 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Eriksson2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the above demonstrates that the order of individual learning versus social
 learning strongly affects the evolutionary scope of different forms of
 social learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases prestige-based cues, which presuppose information of the predicted
 survival of observed phenotypes, will not be available, so that individuals
 either have to resort to other means of cue integration.
 In this case, conformity-based cues may be more general, as they do not
 rely on direct environmental information, but on a type of `crowdsourcing'
 in which the most prevalent phenotype of the crowd informs one about the
 coming environment.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:supplement:no_prestige"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that when social learning is only based on conformism (while prestige-bas
ed cues are excluded), horizontal social learning indeed replaces prestige-based
 social learning.
 However, the same does not hold for vertical prestige-based cues, as those
 are replaced by environmental maternal effects and individual learning.
 By contrast, vertical social learning based on conformity does not prevail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a direct measure of survival as required by prestige-based cues may
 typically not be feasible, more indirect measures of prestige are still
 possible, for example when survival depends on some aspect of phenotypic
 quality (apart from the phenotype itself; e.g., health or energy reserves)
 and this quality can be observed, a ranking would be possible.
 However, the ability to rank others dependent on quality may also imply
 that a focal individual has information about their own quality, which
 is something that is not included in the current model.
 Likely, personal information about a focal individual's state may affect
 the likelihood that it engages in individual or social learning.
 Indeed, such state-dependent effects

 of social information acquisition may be an important way towards explaining
 findings of consistent individual differences in social learning strategies

 (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), the information content of different cues has been classified as either
 selection-based or detection-based, with the aim of explaining differences
 in inheritance fidelity.
 Selection-based cues arise when phenotypic variants become correlated to
 a local environment through differential selection.
 An example are genetic cues, where local adaptation results in the association
 of different genetic variants to different selective conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Leimar2006,Dall2015,Leimar2019"

 or maternal phenotypic effects, where selection on the maternal phenotype
 before reproduction results in associations between the maternal phenotype
 and the local environment

LatexCommand citep
key "Kuijper2015,Kuijper2016,English2015,McNamara2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 By contrast, detection-based cues arise when information is directly detected
 from the environment and subsequently used to modulate phenotypes (which
 can subsequently be transmitted to offspring).
 The obvious example of such a detection-based effect is individual learning,
 but also maternal environmental effects resemble a scenario where a phenotype
 is only transmitted to offspring once it has been detected 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Shea2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In case of social learning, prestige-based cues are clearly detection-based,
 as they involve a measure of phenotypic performance in its current environment.
 By contrast, conformity-based cues can be both selection and detection-based,
 as conformity is a function of the distribution of the different phenotypes
 in the local deme: this distribution is both a result of differential survival
 selection and of individuals modulating their phenotypes via detection-based
 mechanisms (i.e., individual learning).
 Consequently, conformity-based social learning can result in either short-term
 inheritance of variants (when those variants are newly generated each generatio
n through detection-based mechanisms), or it can result in long-term inheritance
 (when a variant is copied because it is the most frequent due to differential
 selection).

The current study has only scratched the surface when it comes to integrating
 social learning and cultural evolution with other forms of cue integration.
 To study the interplay of different cue integration mechanisms, our model
 considered a scenario of local adaptation to a variable environment, as
 has been the subject of most previous studies of cue integration (e.g.,

 By contrast, how multiple forms of cue integration (among which social
 learning) coevolve in other contexts, such as cooperative decision making

 has seen much less attention.
 Previous models which focused on a limited number of cues have shown that
 allowing for the coevolution of multiple forms of social learning (e.g.,
 conformity and prestige biases) can substantially alter the evolutionary
 scope of cooperation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Molleman2013a,Molleman2013,VanCleve2016"

 This raises the question how integration of multiple cues will affect the
 outcome of such cooperative games, particularly when each cue may provide
 a different aspect of information about cooperation: for example, genetic
 cues may inform about current relatedness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, parental cues may inform about fluctuations in local competition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and social learning could inform about the ongoing levels of helping and
 harming.
 As being able to respond to other individuals can substantially affect
 the level of cooperation (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 based on conformity (
\begin_inset Formula $h_{c}$
\end_inset

) prevails.
 Panel C: when individually learned environmental cues are unreliable (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\mathrm{ind}}=0.5$
\end_inset

), we find that this has little effect on horizontal social learning based
 on prestige (
\begin_inset Formula $h_{p}$
\end_inset

; compare with panel B), yet individuals now more strongly rely on vertically
 learned cues based on prestige rather than individually learned cues.
 Panel D: when both individually learned and horizontally learned cues are
 unreliable, vertically learned cues based on prestige prevail in autocorrelated
 environments.

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{h}}=1.0$

Informational value of the different learned cues.
 Depicted are the correlations between the adult selective environment 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(t)$
\end_inset

 and individually and socially learned cues at the preceding juvenile stage.
 When environments are positively autocorrelated (left-hand side where 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p<0.5$
\end_inset

) we find that vertical conformity-based cues are (on average) the worst
 predictor of the selective environment, whereas horizontal prestige-based
 cues are the best predictor of the selective environment.
 By contrast, in negatively autocorrelated environments, horizontal conformism-b
ased cues are positively correlated with the selective environment, while
 all other cues are typically negatively correlated.
 Individually learned cues and conformity-based horizontal social cues have
 the largest magnitude in negatively autocorrelated environments.
 Each dot depicts the average correlation over 5 replicate simulations,
 while envelopes reflect sample standard deviations.

Juvenile cues overview

\begin_layout Standard
Most important cues affecting juvenile phenotype determination (i.e., before
 horizontal social learning).
 Vertical prestige biases and individual learning mostly predominate.
 However, when fidelities of both vertical social learning and individual
 learning are low (top left corner of each panel), maternal effects typically
 prevail.
 Cases where vertical social learning based on conformity evolve (green
 areas) despite high levels of noise in vertical social learning merely
 reflect the generation of phenotypic variance: horizontal prestige-based
 learning (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Juvenile phenotype determination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap from the main text, the juvenile phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 that is developed after individual learning is a logistic function of a
 weighted sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}$
\end_inset

 of different cues an individual has received.
 We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
u_{\mathrm{juv}} & =\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}}\right)}\label{eq:supplement:liability}\\
\bar{x}_{\mathrm{juv}} & =a_{\mathrm{g}}x_{\mathrm{gen}}+a_{\mathrm{\mathrm{ind}}}x_{\mathrm{ind}}\nonumber \\
 & +m_{\mathrm{m}}x_{\mathrm{mat,phen}}+m_{\mathrm{e}}x_{\mathrm{mat,envt}}\nonumber \\
 & +v_{\mathrm{p}}x_{\mathrm{vert,prestige}}+v_{c}x_{\mathrm{vert,conformity}},\label{eq:supplement:xbar:juvenile}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

s in the equation above are the values of each of the different cues, each
 of which is weighed by a sensitivity locus that can flexibly evolve.
 Regarding the evolving sensitivity loci, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{g}}$
\end_inset

 is the sensitivity to the genetic cue 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{gen}}$
\end_inset

 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The locus 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mathrm{ind}}$
\end_inset

 reflects evolving sensitivity to individually learned cues 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{ind}}$
\end_inset

 that inform about the state of local environment at birth (see section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:supplement:Individually-learned-cues"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 The locus 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end_inset

 reflects evolving sensitivity to the maternal phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{mat,phen}}$
\end_inset

 as a cue, while the locus 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\mathrm{e}}$
\end_inset

 reflects evolving sensitivity to the maternal environment 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{mat,envt}}$
\end_inset

 as a cue (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:supplement:Maternal-cues"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Finally, the juvenile phenotype is also influenced by vertical social learning:
 here, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{p}}$
\end_inset

 reflects evolving sensitivity to vertically learned phenotypic cues based
 on prestige biases 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{vert,\mathrm{prestige}}}$
\end_inset

 (see section

 The locus 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mathrm{c}}$

 reflects evolving sensitivity to vertically learned phenotypic cues based
 on conformity biases (see section

Following similar models by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the value of the genetic cue 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{gen}}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{gen}}=\sum_{i=0}^{n_{\mathrm{g}}}g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, it is the sum of the allelic values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\mathrm{g}}=3$
\end_inset

 unlinked, diploid genetic cue loci 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Each allele can have values in the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1\leq g_{i}\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, limited dispersal can result in scenarios where alleles become
 associated with the local environment, so that alleles become informative.
 Note that alleles of the genetic cue themselves are not involved in local
 adaptation, they purely have an informational function.
 The role of genetic cues is further discussed in

\begin_layout Standard
Juveniles perform individual learning about the state of their local environment
s by observing a juvenile environmental cue 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{ind}}$
\end_inset

.
 To this end, each individual independently observes a binary cue reflecting
 the state of the local environment.
 The cue is equal to the actual environmental state (value 
\begin_inset Formula $-1/2$
\end_inset

 in environment 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{low}}$
\end_inset

, value 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{high}}$
\end_inset

) with a probability given by the cue fidelity parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\leq q_{\mathrm{juv}}\leq1$

\begin_inset Formula $1-q_{\mathrm{juv}}$

 an individual receives a cue associated with the opposite environmental

Maternal cues

\begin_layout Standard
Juveniles receive two maternal cues: the first is a maternal phenotypic
 cue 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{mat,phen}}=u_{\mathrm{ad}}(t-1)-1/2$
\end_inset

 that reflects the value of the maternal phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq u_{\mathrm{ad}}(t-1)\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 By subtracting 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{ad}}(t-1)$
\end_inset

 we standardise the maternal phenotype between 
\begin_inset Formula $-1/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 so that the maternal phenotypic cue has the same range as other plastic
 cues (and hence evolved cue sensitivities can be directly compared).
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{ad}}(t-1)$
\end_inset

 is itself a function of her mother's phenotype 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\mathrm{ad}}(t-2)$
\end_inset

 (a so-called cascading parental effect: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The cue is equal to the actual environmental state (value

\begin_inset Formula $1/2$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1-q_{\mathrm{mat}}$
\end_inset

 an individual receives a cue associated with the opposite environmental
 state.
 We assume that all offspring born form the same mother obtain the same
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{mat,envt}}$

 (i.e., errors act at the level of the brood, rather than at the level of

 of observed models.
 To this end, learners rank the potential survival payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $S(u_{\mathrm{ad},i})$
\end_inset

 of each individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in a random sample of

 The cue

\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\geq0.5$

 We then have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

 We have also considered alternative configurations where
